# Delete Node in a Singly-Linked List

This code challenge involves implementing a function to delete a node in a singly-linked list given only access to that node directly.

## Problem Statement

You are given access to a node in a singly-linked list, and you need to delete that node from the list. The given node is not the tail node, and you won't have access to the head of the list.

## Solution Approach

To solve this problem, you can copy the value of the next node to the current node and then delete the next node. This effectively removes the current node from the list.
